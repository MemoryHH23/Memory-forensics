# Memory-forensics
A memory forensics analysis using Volatility and PEStudio made by students
Memory Forensics & Malware Analysis

**Project Description**

The purpose of this project is to perform memory analysis on a captured RAM image to detect suspicious processes and to analyze potential malware components.

**Objectives**

The main objectives of this project are:\
Enumerate running processes from a memory dump using Volatility.\
Identify suspicious or abnormal processes based on forensic indicators.\
Extract and analyze suspicious binaries from memory.\
Analyze extracted binaries using PEStudio to identify indicators of compromise.\
Create YARA rules to detect similar malware in future analyses.\
Document findings and ensure transparency when using AI-assisted tools.

**Tools Used**

The following tools were used during the analysis:\
Volatility - for memory analysis and process enumeration.\
PEStudio - for static analysis of extracted executables.\
LLM studio google/gemma-3-12b AI - used to assist in drafting YARA rules and summarizing findings, with all results manually verified.
